# Portfolio
My first portfolio
This is my first attempt at making a small portfolio card/site.
Im interested in learning front end development, with possibly leading to more back end .... but the road is long.
I am learning HTML and CSS just now and hope to practice and learn for a minimum of 1 hour a day, *shrugs shoulders*, hey, whats the worst that can happen.
any advice help direction would be appreciated, but remember i am a brand new n00b ... also old. 
Thanks.
