        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            <br><br>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
            <br><br>
            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
            <br><br>
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
            <br><br>
            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
            <br><br>
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

            <h2>Why use CSS</h2>
            <br>
            These are the three major benefits of CSS:
            <br><br>
            <h3>1) Solves a big problem</h3>
            <br>
            Before CSS, tags like font, color, background style, element alignments, border and size had to be repeated on every web page. This was a very long process. For example: If you are developing a large website where fonts and color information are added on every single page, it will be become a long and expensive process. CSS was created to solve this problem. It was a W3C recommendation.
            <br><br>
            <h3>2) Saves a lot of time</h3>
            <br>
            CSS style definitions are saved in external CSS files so it is possible to change the entire website by changing just one file.
            <br><br>
            <h3>3) Provide more attributes</h3>
            <br>
            CSS provides more detailed attributes than plain HTML to define the look and feel of the website.
