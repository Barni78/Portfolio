        <h2>Health &amp; Safety</h2>
           <p>Safety and health at work refer to guidelines, programs, and practices that safeguard workers’ safety, well-being, and health. The ultimate purpose of any safety and health program is to provide the most secure working environment and minimize the likelihood of injuries, accidents, and deaths on the job. <br><br>
            Health and safety at work safeguard the health of clients, the general population, and all other people who could be in the same surroundings. If health and safety guidelines are adhered to, they help stop accidents and decrease the chance of injury to employees and illnesses. They can also cut medical expenses, sick leave, and disability benefits.
            <br><br>
            Regardless of what it does, any organization is accountable for adhering to health and safety guidelines at work. These rules are clearly stated, and if a business fails to comply with them, it may be held accountable for any damage or accidents. In addition, companies have a financial and legal obligation to comply with safety and health standards. They also have a moral obligation to ensure employees’ health and safety and safety. <br><br>
        <h2>Health And Safety Definition</h2>
            Health and safety are areas of great importance in any workplace. A safe and healthy work environment is essential to the well-being of employees, customers, and other public members. Health and safety concerns can arise from various sources, including exposure to hazardous materials, unsafe work practices, and accidents.
            <br><br>
            To ensure the health and safety of workers, it is important for employers to clearly understand what health and safety hazards exist in their workplace. Employers should also be aware of the potential consequences of exposure to these hazards. By identifying and controlling workplace health and safety hazards, employers can help protect their employees from injuries, illnesses, and death.
            <br><br>
            There are a variety of federal and state laws that govern health and safety in the workplace. These laws establish minimum standards for employers to follow to protect workers from potentially hazardous conditions. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing these laws. State agencies also play a role in enforcing health and safety laws. <br><br>

            <h2>Workplace Safety Definition</h2>

            Workplace safety is the condition of being free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm and includes safe and healthful working conditions. A safe and healthy workplace is one where employees can perform their duties without exposure to risks that could lead to injury, illness, or death.
            <br><br>
            When most people think of workplace safety, they immediately think of physical hazards such as slips, trips and falls. However, many other types of workplace hazards can threaten employees’ safety and health. These include ergonomic hazards, chemical hazards, biological hazards, and psychological hazards.</p>
